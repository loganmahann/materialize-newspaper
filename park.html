					<body><p>MANAYUNK — The Friends of Pretzel Park have announced the start of construction to replace old playground equipment in Pretzel Park.</p>

					<p>For several years now, volunteers with the Friends of Pretzel Park have been working with city organizations, including the Community Design Collaborative, to develop plans for major park improvements, including playground equipment, which was in poor repair.</p>

					<p>The Friends of Pretzel Park thanked Councilman Curtis Jones Jr., who helped secure funding for this project.</p>

					<p>New equipment has already been manufactured. It includes two major play structures — one for older children and one for younger children — and new swings, as well as some smaller play equipment.</p>

					<p>All new structures will be placed within the current footing of the playground, and new ground cover will replace the current foam tiles.</p>

					<p>Demolition is expected to begin immediately. The city estimates six weeks are needed for construction, although weather delays are expected.</p>

					<p>Plans for a neighborhood celebration, including a ribbon-cutting ceremony with local officials, are underway. Those who might be interested in volunteering or participating in these activities are encouraged to contact the Friends of Pretzel Park.</p>

					<p>Located in the heart of Manayunk, Pretzel Park is a part of Philadelphia’s Fairmont Park system. The park is cared for by the city, with help from the Friends of Pretzel Park, an umbrella organization of the Manayunk Neighborhood Council that is also registered as an official Friends group with the Fairmont Park Conservancy. The Friends of Pretzel Park also run events in the park, including a seasonal farmers market.

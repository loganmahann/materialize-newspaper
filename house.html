					<body><p>ROXBOROUGH â€” Demolition work recently began at 8810 Ridge Ave. in Roxborough.</p>

					<p>Although the property had been part of the list of structures that was submitted as part of the Ridge Avenue Historic District planning, the property had been purchased and subdivided before the legislation was approved by city council.</p>

					<p>According to Rich Giordano, president of the Upper Roxborough Civic Association, the building on the property was determined by the Department of Licenses and Inspection to be "imminently dangerous." Given that assessment, the historic commission subsequently voted last November to allow for its destruction by a 4-3 vote.</p>
